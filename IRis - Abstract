Audience Response Systems are deployed in a wide variety of applications these days. The simplest of such wireless systems use Radio Frequency for communication. The others work on Bluetooth, WiFi or Internet. Some major drawbacks with such architecture are higher power consumption, considerable hardware cost and unavoidable transmission of signals outside the desired area.

"IRis" as we call it, has been mindcrafted to tackle these very problems. We conceptualized a modification in the technology already in use to develop a low cost alternative and at the same time enhance the data privacy. At the heart of IRis lies an IR communication architecture instead of RF. Needless to say, this would cut down the cost and power consumption by a large fraction. Also, since IR communication at its core requires a line of sight interaction, the response of audience in case of sensitive matters can be kept under tight wraps within the 4 walls of the conference room. The threat of external eavesdropping which prevails in case of RF communication is eliminated. This makes IRis, an ideal military grade product. Apart from this its applications include but obviously not limited to education, decision support assessment, game shows and mass feedback gathering.

Coming to the technicalities of the project, we propose to build the remotes using Attiny85 microcontrollers. Since multiple IR transmitters will obviously cause a problem of interference, IRis will employ Time Division Multiplexing using Master-Slave protocol to ensure hassle free communication. At the present retail price, each remote is expected to cost around Rs 150/-. If time permits, we would like to integrate a cloud server IRis in order to sync all responses to the cloud time and again.

In the future, our major focus shall be on further reducing the cost of production. This would me achieved by wholesale purchase of components and perhaps designing of an embedded system to cater to the specific needs. Another idea worth implementing is increasing the communication efficiency and speed of this architecture by fabricating custom modules intended to serve this very application.
